# American Military Operation Name Generating Device

This was originally a CGI script from 2001:

http://www.ftrain.com/cgi-bin/l_operation.cgi?num_ops=10

It was written in late 2001 when we were all pretty depressed about
the turn of events and everyone had lost their mind with hatred and
anger. I had been working in Israel and thinking a ton about the way
that European and Middle Eastern cultures interact. I lost my job on
September 13, 2001 and went home to Brooklyn. Downtown Manhattan was
a huge smoking hole and everything smelled like burning concrete
everywhere you went. I talked to people on the phone a lot and sent
many long emails.

I was 26 and there was no work anywhere, so I made this CGI script
and put it on the web. Some people found it in poor taste. A friend
of mine who lost a number of people in the attacks gently said,
"it's a little too soon for it to be funny for me."

She had these friends who worked in security and called me on the
phone to read me an email from one of those friends. There was a
point where we had considered nuclear weapons. Just one of the facts
from that era that stands out to me.

This script now has a weird second-life on the Internet as a tool
for various people who need military-sounding names for work or
hobbies, including military history re-enactors.

Which is something to think about: At some point, the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq will be fair game for the re-enactors, with the
same fake weapons and the same enemies. And Americans will put on
the clothes of the Taliban. Maybe American women (or men) will wear
burqas as part of the reenactment. We're not there yet, it still
feels almost impossible. But it always comes around much sooner than
you think. This script, which was intended as a parody of the news
in October 2001, can become part of that very advanced form of play.
