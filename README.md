## About this software

### History

This software program was written in late 2001 when we were all
pretty depressed about the turn of events and everyone in positions
of power in the media and in government appeared to have lost their
minds. And still appear to have lost their minds, frankly.

I had been working at a startup in Israel and thinking about the way
that European and Middle Eastern cultures interact. I lost my job in
Tel Aviv on September 13, 2001 and went home to Brooklyn. Downtown
Manhattan was a huge smoking hole and everything smelled like
burning concrete everywhere you went. I talked to people on the
phone a lot and sent many long emails during that era.

I was 26 and there was no work anywhere, so I made this CGI script
and put it on the web. Some people found it in poor taste. It was in
poor taste. But it was also an era where New Yorkers would go to the
gym together and stand on the ellipticals and watch the
billowing-flag graphics on TV, and whisper to each other "Freedom!"
and laugh. Freedom, let's roll, let the eagle soar, justice---these
all became words used by monsters to justify anything in the months
and years following. Not that we didn't want justice, or freedom. In
fact we really, really wanted both of those things.

A friend of mine who lost a number of people in the attacks looked
at this code and gently said, "it's a little too soon for it to be
funny for me."

She called me on the phone to read me an email from a friend of hers
who worked somewhere in the middle of the government, where big
decisions were made. "Nuclear weapons have not been ruled out." That
was a thing she read over the phone to me.

### Current Usage

This script now has a weird second-life on the Internet as a
tool for various people who need military-sounding names for work or
hobbies, including military history re-enactors.

At some point, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq will be fair game
for the re-enactors, with the same fake weapons and the same
enemies. And Americans will put on the clothes of the Taliban. Maybe
American women (or men) will wear burqas as part of the
reenactment. We're not there yet, it still feels almost
impossible. But it always comes around much sooner than you
think.

Perhaps this Perl script, which was intended as a parody of the news
during the miserable early fall in October 2001, when New York's
throat burned, can become part of that very advanced form of play.
